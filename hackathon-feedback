Calculator Website
Nice for a first hackathon.
I can see by your code you've learnt a lot the past month!
Your use of functions, conditionals and dom manipulation is very good.
I managed to break your calcualtor after clicking C and then = so you might want to look into that.
Other than that fantastic job!
